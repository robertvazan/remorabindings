Remora Bindings is a Java library that offers two-way data bindings that glue UI widgets to data sources.
Contrary to most other binding APIs, Remora Bindings does not offer any built-in change notification or reactivity
and instead relies on [transparent reactivity](https://blog.machinezoo.com/transparent-reactive-programming)
offered by libraries like [Hookless](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/).
